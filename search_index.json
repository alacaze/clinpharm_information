["course-structure.html", "Section 6 Course structure", " Section 6 Course structure All of the courses within the Clinical Pharmacy Program follow a similar structure. While this structure can seem complex when you first encounter it, it is a structure that we and previous students have found to work quite well to support engaging and effective online learning. Key elements of the course structure: You will be assigned into a group with your fellow students Group work is an important part of the program. One of the strengths of the program is having the opportunity to learn from each other. Groups typically have 5–10 members. Online tutorials are conducted (approximately) once every 4 weeks. Each course typically has 1 introductory tutorial held in the week before semester starts and 3 tutorials that form part of the learning activities for the course Most of the courses are divided into 3 modules of work. These modules include readings, video, voice-over power points and a range of other activities. Each of these modules is typically associated with one of the tutorials. Assessment can differ between courses, but most include the following Module participation (Blogs and quizzes). These are typically small activities related to learning modules to encourage active learning. Module tasks (Green Discussion Boards or Activities). These task are small-to-medium sized tasks linked to particular modules and provide an opportunity put some component of the module into action and get some feedback. These tasks can be marked individually or as a group. Some of these tasks result in an output on a “Green Discussion Board”. Tutorial presentation (Blue Discussion Board). You are asked to address a task as a group for each module and then present the outcome at the online tutorial. All group members participate in addressing the task—this takes place on the “Blue Discussion Board”. There is usually a roster for who presents at a specific tutorial. The tutorials then provide an opportunity to hear and discuss what each groups have found. For many of the courses an external expert is invited to attend the tutorial and contribute to the discussion. Assignments are typically larger tasks used to provide you an opportunity to demonstrate that you have meet specific learning objectives with the course. Assignments are often linked to specific modules within the course. "],

We all come from different personal and professional backgrounds and experiences.

Working effectively as part of a group is also a key skill for all health professionals, and further developing these skills is an important part of developing your practice. All of the courses in the program rely on group work to some extent. For many of the courses, the clearest example of group work are the activities associated with each tutorial. In these activities you work as a group to respond to the task and then present and discuss what you have found at the tutorial. These activities are also assessed as a group—that is, all members of the group get the same mark providing they have contributed to the activity. "],

The key aspects of the program to keep in mind when deciding on your study schedule: PHRM7010 is designed to be completed at the start of the program. Complete PHRM7010 in your first semester of study, unless you start the program in Semester 2 (in which case complete PHRM7010 in the following semester). PHRM7033 is designed to draw on the other two therapeutics subjects, PHRM7031 and PHRM7032. PHRM7031 and PHRM7032 can be completed in any order, but try to complete both before PHRM7033. (If needed, you can complete PHRM7032 and PHRM7033 at the same time) PHRM7095 is the capstone project and should be completed in your final semester of study. You need to complete PHRM7021 prior to PHRM7095; you develop the project plan (and the skills in developing project plans) in PHRM7021 "],
["workload.html", "Section 14 Workload", " Section 14 Workload Each subject in the Clinical Pharmacy Program is 2 units. A full-time load of subjects at UQ is 8 units, which is expected to take you 40 hours per week throughout the semester to successfully complete. You are expected to spend about 10 hours each week on learning activities and assessment for each 2 unit course. Some people get by with a little less, others spend considerably more. How much you get out of the program is dependent on how much you put in. Very few people can manage to complete a full-time academic load while also working full-time. We don’t recommend it. The program is designed to be completed part-time (2 years) or flexible part-time (&gt; 2 years) while you are working as a pharmacist. A key objective of the program is to change the way you practice. Applying the things you are learning to your work, and bringing your work experience into the learning activities is an important part of the program. "]
